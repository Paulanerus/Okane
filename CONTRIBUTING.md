# Contributing to Okane

Thank you for considering contributing to Okane! As a solo developer, I'm excited to have others join me in improving and expanding this project. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving documentation, your help is appreciated.

## Communication

While there’s no official Discord or forum, feel free to open an issue, pull request or message me directly on Discord (.paulee) if you have questions or suggestions. I’ll do my best to respond as quickly as possible.

## Issue Policy

When reporting bugs or requesting features, please:

- Keep each issue focused on a single bug or feature request.
- Provide as much detail as possible to help reproduce the bug or understand the feature.
- Use the issue tracker for bugs and feature requests only. For build issues or other questions, mention them in the pull request or issue comments.

## Code Contribution Guidelines

I aim to keep Okane's codebase clean, readable, and maintainable. Here are a few guidelines to follow:

### Do:

- Write clean, idiomatic C++ code, adhering to modern C++ standards.
- Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly describe their purpose.
- Break your changes into small, atomic commits, each addressing a single issue or feature.
- Write clear and concise commit messages. Please follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- Conform to the project coding style found in [CodingStyle.md](doc/CodingStyle.md).
- Ensure your changes compile and run without errors or warnings.

### Don’t:

- Make changes outside the scope of your pull request.
- Submit code that doesn't compile or introduces warnings.
- Include commented-out code in your pull requests.
- Submit large architectural changes without prior discussion.

## Pull Request Process

When you're ready to submit your changes:

1. Ensure your code adheres to the guidelines above.
2. Open a pull request with a clear title and description of what your changes do.
3. I'll review your changes as soon as possible. If any adjustments are needed, I'll let you know.
4. If your pull request isn't getting attention after a few days, feel free to gently ping me.

## Closing Notes

I deeply appreciate any contributions, whether big or small. My goal is to make Okane a useful tool for C++ developers, and your contributions help make that possible. Let's build something great together!
